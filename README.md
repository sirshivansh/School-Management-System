# School-Management-System
A simple, user-friendly **School Management System** built using Python's `tkinter` for GUI and `sqlite3` for the backend database. This project allows basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing student and teacher records.
## 📌 Features

### 👨‍🎓 Student Management
- Add new students
- View list of students
- Search student by Roll Number
- Delete student records

### 👩‍🏫 Teacher Management
- Add new teachers
- View list of teachers
- Search teacher by TID (Teacher ID)
- Delete teacher records

### 🔐 Security
- Password-protected access to the main interface (`Default password: 123456789`)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technology      |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Frontend    | `tkinter` (Python GUI library) |
| Backend     | `sqlite3` (local lightweight SQL database) |
| Language    | Python 3.x      |

## 📁 File Structure
SMSminiPro.py # Main Python script (GUI + logic + database setup) school_management.db # SQLite database file (auto-created on first run)


## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install Python 3** (if not installed):
